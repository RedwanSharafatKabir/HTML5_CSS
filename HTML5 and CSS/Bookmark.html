    <h2 id="Result">Death Toll Revised</h2>
    <p>
        Health Services Director-General Dr Anil Jasinghe said the death toll from the Easter Sunday attacks was not as high as
        previously estimated. The revised figure now stands at 253, not 359. In a statement, the Health Services Director-General said
        the miscalculation had occurred as a result of the difficulty in numbering body parts. “In bombing such as this,
        bodies are subject to great harm and in some cases destroyed. Since bodies are in parts it is difficult to identify them as a whole.
        For this reason, it is very difficult to give an accurate number of those dead and we can only give an estimation,” he said.

        Health Services Director-General Dr Anil Jasinghe said the death toll from the Easter Sunday attacks was not as high as
        previously estimated. The revised figure now stands at 253, not 359. In a statement, the Health Services Director-General said
        the miscalculation had occurred as a result of the difficulty in numbering body parts. “In bombing such as this,
        bodies are subject to great harm and in some cases destroyed. Since bodies are in parts it is difficult to identify them as a whole.
        For this reason, it is very difficult to give an accurate number of those dead and we can only give an estimation,” he said.
